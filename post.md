# whats is racism chapter two: making sense



<br>
hello, freinds. nice to see you agian ( even though I can't see you through the screen) we just started talking about race, but we didn't finish.
with racist white pepole,  race dosn't end. and the confusing thing is that, somtimes we can't change pepole. "chirp chirp(aka cricits)" now you might think I'm crazy, but as obamas wife said in a presidential meeting, "when they go low, we go high" she dosn't mean drunk high. she means that when they don't listen, we do better. and now, I will tell you sompthing bad that happend. on tuesday, a metily ill black man was shoot. he was bring out a knife walking by some polece. the polce thought was a gun, so they killed him. and this is THE ONE OF THE SADIST DEATHS! and if you think that segregation is over, it isn't. schools are still segregated. but the signs are not anymore.
