# What Is  Racism chapter 1. 
What is race? Good question! When you hear the word race, you think of a car racing. But the one we are talking about is sader, and scarier. the only parts of race is as you might know of slavery or segregation. But race is a bit worse! See the pictures of Police using tear gas and black lives mater protesters.

what you are seeing is called polise brutality. Tear gas is something that makes you cry, and then it makes you want to go away from it. the black lives matter protests started in 2013. And in 2020, something awful happened. A black man named George Floyd got choked to death. When the death started happening, he said “I can't breathe” . That ment politely “please, let me go” but sadly, he died. The death took about 8 minutes and 46 seconds. That's when the protesters got REALY mad. If you press this word, Itll take you to a movie wedsite called [“I am not you negro”](https://www.google.com/search?q=i+am+not+your+negro&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS712US715&oq=i+am+not+your+negro&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59j0l3j69i60l3.1469j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and may rest in peace. 
the movie spript was made by James Baldwin, but is read by a different person becuse he died in 1987 of stomach cancer. may both pepole continue in us as we do the thing they wanted us to do before they were dead.
